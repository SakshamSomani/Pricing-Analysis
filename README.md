# Pricing Analysis Project Readme
## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a pricing analysis project conducted in collaboration with CCC Intelligent Solutions. The primary focus of this project was to gain insights into the factors influencing used car prices and to develop a predictive model for estimating these prices.

Key Objectives
1. Understanding the Impact of Various Factors on Used Car Prices
Analyze the influence of diverse factors on the pricing of used cars in the market.
Identify key variables affecting pricing, such as make, model, mileage, year of manufacture, and other relevant parameters.
2. Developing a Predictive Model for Estimating Prices
Create a robust predictive model capable of estimating used car prices based on the identified factors.
Utilize machine learning techniques to incorporate both current market conditions and historical data for accurate predictions.
Major Deliverables
1. Report: Insights into the Factors Affecting Car Prices
A comprehensive report providing detailed insights into the various factors that impact used car prices.
Analysis of key trends and patterns observed during the study, aiding in a better understanding of market dynamics.
2. Predictive Model: A Robust Tool for Estimating Prices
Codebase for the developed predictive model, ensuring transparency and replicability.
Integration of current market data and historical information for the model's effectiveness.
